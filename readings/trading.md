#### Points:
- moving average = mean of the subset of values in a sequence.
- larger = less affected by a single result, smaller more likely to be affected by a single result.
- ie 1: trending upward. (buy) MA-50 goes above MA. (short) MA-50 goes below MA.
- ie 2: revert to mean. (buy) MA-50 10% below MA. (short) MA-50 10% above MA.
- ie 3: crossover. (buy) MA-50 above MA-200. (short) MA-50 goes below MA-200.
- EMA provides greater weight on more recent prices. React quicker. Could help to detect changes in trend quicker due to that.
- SMA tend to give a better indication of long-term trend vs EMA
- EMA tend to help identify earlier trends vs SMA
